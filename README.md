# Magento-store-Mageshop-9

Mageshop-9 is a Magento v2.3.5 store that I have customised with:
- custom built magento modules
- data-driven Views/Layouts/Block/Templates
- widgets to display dynamic content like best sellers
- database schema modifications
- and many magento code-based-customisations.

The store runs on **Docker** and has **Redis caching** built-in as front-end cache to speed up page loads. **Docker Engine** is running on top of **Linux Ubuntu**.
